        "description":"Apple on Tuesday unveiled its next generation of iPhones - a line-up that will boast better cameras, faster processors, a new charging system and a price hike for the fanciest model. The showcase at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, in the US comes as the company tries to reverse a mild slump that has seen its sales drop from last year in three consecutive quarters. The malaise is a key reason Apple's stock price has dipped by about 10 per cent since mid-July, dropping the company's market value below the $3 trillion (â‚¬2.7 trillion) threshold it reached for the first time earlier this summer."
